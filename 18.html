    <b>What is this?</b>
    <br>
In JavaScript, the this keyword refers to an object.
<br>
Which object depends on how this is being invoked (used or called).
<br>
The this keyword refers to different objects depending on how it is used:
<br>
In an object method, this refers to the object.
<br>Alone, this refers to the global object.
<br>In a function, this refers to the global object.
<br>In a function, in strict mode, this is undefined.
<br>In an event, this refers to the element that received the event.
<br>Methods like call(), apply(), and bind() can refer this to any object.

<p id="demo"></p>
<p id="demo2"></p>

const person = {
    firstName: "John",

    id       : 5566,
    fullName : function() {
      return this.firstName + " " + this.lastName;
    }
